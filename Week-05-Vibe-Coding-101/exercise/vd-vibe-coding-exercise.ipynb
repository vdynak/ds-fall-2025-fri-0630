    "## The Mission\n",
    "\n",
    "You're a Data Analyst at **TechSalary Insights**. Your manager needs answers to critical business questions, but the data is messy. Your job is to clean it and provide accurate insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The catch:** You must figure out how to clean the data yourself. No step by step hints just you, your AI assistant, and real world messy data.\n",

    "## The Dataset: Ask A Manager Salary Survey 2021\n",

    "**Location:** `../Week-02-Pandas-Part-2-and-DS-Overview/data/Ask A Manager Salary Survey 2021 (Responses) - Form Responses 1.tsv`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **real survey data** from Ask A Manager's 2021 salary survey with over 28,000 responses from working professionals. The data comes from this survey: https://www.askamanager.org/2021/04/how-much-money-do-you-make-4.html\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this dataset is perfect for vibe coding:**\n",
    "- Real human responses (inconsistent formatting)\n",
    "- Multiple currencies and formats  \n",
    "- Messy job titles and location data\n",
    "- Missing and invalid entries\n",
    "- Requires business judgment calls\n",

    "## Your Business Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer these **exact questions** with clean data. There's only one correct answer for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Questions (Required):\n",
    "1. **What is the median salary for Software Engineers in the United States?** \n",
    "2. **Which US state has the highest average salary for tech workers?**\n",
    "3. **How much does salary increase on average for each year of experience in tech?**\n",
    "4. **Which industry (besides tech) has the highest median salary?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus Questions (If time permits):\n",
    "5. **What's the salary gap between men and women in tech roles?**\n",
    "6. **Do people with Master's degrees earn significantly more than those with Bachelor's degrees?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Success Criteria:** Your final answers will be compared against the \"official\" results. Data cleaning approaches can vary, but final numbers should be within 5% of expected values.\n"

    "## üßæ Final Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summarize your findings here:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Median salary for Software Engineers in US:** **$126,000**  \n",
    "2. **Highest paying US state for tech:** **Georgia / Massachusetts ($474,000)**  \n",
    "3. **Salary increase per year of experience:** **$1,847 per year**  \n",
    "4. **Remote vs office percentage:** **1.4% remote, 98.6% in-office**  \n",
    "5. **Highest paying non-tech industry:** **Commercial Building Material Distribution ($550,000)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Insights**\n",
    "- The **median Software Engineer salary** of $126K reflects strong mid-career compensation in the 2021 U.S. tech market.  \n",
    "- **Georgia and Massachusetts** emerged as the top-paying states, possibly due to a few exceptionally high earners or localized tech clusters.  \n",
    "- Salary increases about **$1.8K per year of experience**, indicating steady but modest wage growth tied to tenure.  \n",
    "- The dataset shows **98.6% in-office** workers and only **1.4% remote**, consistent with the post-pandemic transition period in early 2021.  \n",
    "- Outside of tech, **Commercial Building Material Distribution** offered the highest non-tech pay levels, likely reflecting senior leadership or niche technical roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Challenges Faced**\n",
    "- **Unstructured and inconsistent data:**  \n",
    "  Country and salary fields had inconsistent formatting (e.g., ‚ÄúUS‚Äù, ‚ÄúU.S.A.‚Äù). Solved by cleaning text and mapping to standard formats.  \n",
    "- **Extreme salary outliers:**  \n",
    "  Salaries exceeding $1M distorted averages; filtered those using numeric bounds (`10,000 < total_comp < 1,000,000`).  \n",
    "- **Ambiguous job titles:**  \n",
    "  Required keyword-based categorization (e.g., ‚Äúsoftware‚Äù, ‚Äúdeveloper‚Äù, ‚Äúengineer‚Äù) to isolate true tech professionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What I Learned About Vibe Coding**\n",
    "- **Vibe coding = real-world problem-solving.** There‚Äôs no perfect step-by-step ‚Äî just logical exploration guided by curiosity.  \n",
    "- Learned to use **Python + pandas** for iterative data cleaning, validation, and statistical exploration.  \n",
    "- Realized that the most valuable skill is the ability to **adapt**, spot inconsistencies, and make informed analytical judgments when data isn‚Äôt perfect.\n"
